    <p>
      Hi, I'm Peter — a <HighLight>Software Engineer</HighLight> with around 2 years of experience working on web applications using
      React.js, Next.js, and Node.js.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked on building UI features, integrating REST APIs, and fixing issues across both frontend and backend while
      contributing to real production codebases. I enjoy writing clean, readable code and improving my skills step by step.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently preparing for the <HighLight>AWS Certified Developer – Associate (DVA-C02)</HighLight> certification and gaining
      more hands-on experience with cloud and backend development.
    </p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy building side projects, learning new tools, and improving my development workflow.</p>
